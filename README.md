# netX_Case_Competition_UMcGill
My partner Illia Negovora from University of Ottawa and myself from University of Windsor got accepted to the prestigious technology case competition hosted by NetX from McGill University. 

Based on our CV and experience, we are assinged a Canada's DATAPERFORMERS COMPNAY -  AN APPLIED AI COMPANY BUILDING ADVANCED CROSS-INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS.

Our case problem will be released around 3pm on March 20th, 2021. So excited to create an AI based solution this weekend. :) Can't wait to see the results of other 15 teams and companies.
